# Python-Telco-Customer-Churn-Analysis

This project analyzes customer churn behavior in a telecom company using exploratory data analysis (EDA). The objective is to identify key factors influencing customer churn and to provide actionable, data-driven recommendations to improve customer retention and reduce revenue loss.

Objectives
- Analyze overall churn behavior and churn distribution.
- Identify customer segments with elevated churn risk.
- Examine the impact of demographics, services, contracts, and payment methods on churn.
- Translate analytical findings into business recommendations.

Dataset
- The dataset contains customer-level records including:
- Demographics: gender, senior citizen, partner, dependents
- Account information: tenure, contract type, payment method, billing type
- Services: internet service, online security, backup, device protection, tech support
- Target variable: churn (Yes/No)

Tools and Technologies
- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Jupyter Notebook

Key Findings
- Approximately 26.54% of customers have churned, indicating a significant retention challenge.
- Senior citizens exhibit a higher churn rate compared to non-senior customers.
- Customers without dependents are more likely to churn than those with dependents.
- Churn is highest during the first few months of service, while long-tenured customers are more likely to remain.
- Customers on month-to-month contracts have significantly higher churn than those on annual or two-year contracts.
- Lack of online security, backup, device protection, and tech support is associated with higher churn.
- Fiber optic internet users demonstrate higher churn, potentially due to service or pricing dissatisfaction.
- Customers using electronic checks for payment are more likely to churn compared to those using automatic payment methods.

Recommendations
- Implement structured onboarding and engagement programs during the first 90 days of service to reduce early-stage churn.
- Encourage customers to transition from month-to-month to long-term contracts through incentives and loyalty programs.
- Bundle value-added services such as online security, backup, device protection, and technical support to increase perceived value.
- Develop targeted retention strategies for high-risk segments including senior citizens, fiber optic users, and short-tenure customers.
- Promote automatic payment methods to reduce billing friction and improve customer retention.
- Establish churn risk monitoring using key indicators such as tenure, contract type, service adoption, and payment behavior.

Business Impact
- Applying these recommendations can lead to improved customer retention, increased customer lifetime value, reduced revenue leakage, and enhanced customer satisfaction.
